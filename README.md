# About

Just a simple program making it easier to send bytes through wiringPi


## Usage

First you have to install the [wiringpi](https://projects.drogon.net/raspberry-pi/wiringpi/download-and-install/) library.
After that you can compile the example program *send* by executing *make*. 
You may want to changet the used GPIO pin before compilation in the send.cpp source file.
